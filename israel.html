            <h2>Ancient Israel</h2>
            <p>Ancient Israel was first established in biblical times, with early Jewish kingdoms flourishing between the 10th and 6th centuries BCE. These kingdoms were eventually conquered by a series of empires, including the Babylonians, Persians, and Romans.</p>
            <p>After the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Jewish population largely dispersed, marking the start of the Jewish diaspora. Some Jewish communities, however, remained in the region over the centuries.</p>

         <section>
            <h2>Modern Zionism and British Control</h2>
            <p>Modern political Zionism emerged in the late 19th century, influenced by European nationalism and widespread anti-Semitism, sparking a push for a Jewish homeland in historic Palestine.</p>
            <p>British control of the region was established after World War I under the League of Nations mandate, leading to significant Jewish immigration. This intensified tensions with the Arab population. The British Balfour Declaration in 1917 supported a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, but unrest escalated, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>

         <section>
            <h2>Israel’s Independence and Conflict</h2>
            <p>After World War II and the Holocaust, international support for a Jewish state grew. In 1947, the United Nations resolved to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. Israel declared independence in 1948, sparking the first Arab-Israeli war, which left Israel in control of much of the territory originally designated for the Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>Subsequent conflicts, such as the Six-Day War in 1967, expanded Israel's territory but also intensified tensions, especially over the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. The ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict has led to numerous peace attempts, including the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, but lasting peace remains elusive.</p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h2>Israel's Genocide Against Palestine</h2>
            <p>The ongoing situation in Gaza is characterized by widespread violence and destruction, which many observers and human rights organizations describe as genocide. Reports indicate that Israel's military actions have led to the systematic targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and places of worship. Over 43,000 Palestinians have reportedly died since the escalation began in October 2023, with many more injured and displaced. The destruction of essential services has rendered healthcare and education nearly impossible, contributing to a humanitarian crisis that exacerbates suffering and starvation among the population.</p>
            <p>Human rights advocates argue that the Israeli government's actions align with the definitions of genocide under international law, citing deliberate acts of killing, causing severe harm, and imposing conditions of life designed to destroy the Palestinian population. These actions are seen as part of a long-standing strategy aimed at displacing and eradicating Palestinian presence. Additionally, the UN Special Rapporteur has stated that there is "reasonable grounds to believe" that Israel has committed acts amounting to genocide, further emphasizing the urgent need for international intervention to halt these atrocities and provide humanitarian assistance.</p>
